       <div class="response3">Both A Handmade Web by J. R. Carpenter and Taeyoon Choi’s Handmade Computer argue that to truly understand digital technology, one must actively make it rather than passively consume it. Building a website or a computer reveals the invisible infrastructures, labor, and decisions that are often hidden behind smooth interfaces. Choi demonstrates that understanding computation requires slowing down and engaging with its material and historical foundations.

Both readings happened to challenge the tendency to reduce complex systems into clean, computable models. As Choi states, “life can’t be reduced to binary,” a reminder that while we often try to digitize the behaviors of the world, cities and human life. Unlike computers, cities are shaped by uncertainty, emotion, and unpredictable interactions. They operate more like buggy, unfinished programs than perfect systems.

When asked the question of ‘what kinds of computers do we want to use, and what kinds of cities do we want to live in?’ A handmade approach suggests valuing transparency, experimentation, and human-scale systems over efficiency and control.
